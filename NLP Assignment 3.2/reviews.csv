"Taking an Asian tour, we visited Singapore- which was the place I really wanted to visit. Spending some days there we went to the top of the building during the day, the views are incredible. Well with 53+ floors it was bound to be! The shape of the building - 3 towers topped by a ship shaped top is incredible. It’s the place to be to view the firework display, held each evening! There is also a restaurant & swimming pool to facilitate the hotel rooms within the structure. We met up with friends who happened to be over there at the same time & had a great time in the nightclub, and had a ringside seat to watch the light show, drink some wine & dance too! It’s a must visit",positive
We enjoyed our stay at 35th floor garden view! Staff at the concierge was very accommodating to my request to be at the high floor despite surge of guests at that time.We had a great time having breakfast at Spago at 57th floor! It was am Amazing experience!,positive
"Room is spacious, clean and had a great view of gardens by the Bay and the harbour. Lobby was crowded at check in on Saturday but wait wasn’t too long. Stay also came with a care package With hand sanitizer, masks and a mask case - very thoughtful. Great stay overall",positive
We managed to time this just right as the sun was going down. Make sure you are on the left hand side of the viewing platform to be able to see the Gardens by the Bay light show! Beautiful views of a wonderful city! Well worth the entrance fee!,positive
We stayed here for the access to the rooftop pool. The hotel itself is massive and you could easily get lost but it was worth it for us to have access to the rooftop pool. So many options for meals between restaurants and shopping mall attached to the hotel. Also a good location to see different tourist sites like the gardens on the bay,positive
"Room is clean and big. Nice view with balcony. Pool is definitely breathtaking with awesome views. Too sunny to swim in the day, took a swim and relax after 7pm, so windy and cool. Very nice of the hotel to give us a complimentary small slice of cake for our anniversary",positive
Spent five nights in Singapore to acclimatize to jetlag and flight arrival and departure times. Couldn’t justify 5 nights here due to the price but did opt for two nights. We were in a family room which was well appointed and quite spacious. Early check in without a problem. Got a room fridge delivered to store our alcohol and beverages as too pricey from the minibar. Great location. Ate at the Marvel restaurant for the black bunned Batman burger. Not bad. The rooftop pool was worth the price of the rooms. Spent many hours lounging in the sun and soaking in the pool and hot tubs,positive
Iconic! Popular despite it’s $300 -800 room rate. Good service. Incredible infinity pool for unforgettable photos! Outstanding celebrity restaurants like dbBistro and Cut. Wish the rooms were more modern and Japanese “full service” bathrooms installed. Wish TV system was more user friendly.,positive
"Amidst covid-19 with all the travel restrictions, we opted for a staycation at MBS. Our room faces Garden by the Bay and hence we've a spectacular views. The twin room is spacious, making it really comfortable for my 2 big girls and me. The infinity pool was generally quite crowded be it day or night, but it's still worth going to enjoy a good view of the city. No complimentary parking but valet parking is about $13 for 24h with multiple entry. So it's not that expensive is you consider how much you've to pay normally. Nice hotel to check-in to once a while to be a local tourist",positive
"My trip to Marina Bay Sands was absolutely beautiful!!! I very much enjoyed the balcony and how it looks onto the glorious country that is Singapore. It was a genuinely great experience. The service was slightly underwhelming though. I find that in Spago (the one restaurant that is available for public booking) is slightly less cared for than that of the other restaurants. The rooms seem to be lovely and clean, and yes that absolutely beautiful that you see everytime you enter your room. Even though we are in a time of Covid the staff count was at a regular rate. The food is lovely and there are so many restaurants to chose from. Once you have eventually visited all of the facility you can explore the Marina mall which has many shops. A nice thing to do is take a trip to the Gardens By the bay which are lovely and lit up at night. Altogether this was a lovely experience. Thank you Marina Bay Sands Team",positive

"I recently booked myself into a staycation at Marina Bay Sands, whilst I understand why people stay here, the view is incredible, including from the roof top pool - love the fact they limited the pool usage to prevent overcrowding, including at restaurants

My only concern is the hotel is looking quite tired (stains on carpets, couch torn, just general feel) for the price I was expecting a luxurious room, instead of something dated back 10+ years ago...being a hotel that prides itself on occupancy levels averaging 94-99% annually, thus would’ve been a perfect opportunity to improve its already dated product",neutral
"For a 5 star Hotel in Asia the hotel was pretty average. Little things like room keys not working and check-in desks not open were annoying and not what I expected. The iconic infinity pool had the best views in Singapore but its not designed for inclement weather. No sun umbrellas or rain covering so if it does rain, EVERYTHING gets wet. Worth staying only to cross off the bucket list. I won't be coming again.",neutral
"I stayed here early February for work, due to my work i had to travel and stay at hotels, this hotel has good product. My opinion, lacks human touch, i didn't feel the passion to help, and in fact i would say robotic. This hotel will be top class hotel if they master the human portion of the business. Also, do focus on maintenance and housekeeping.",neutral
"We booked Premier Room with Garden View and it comes with balcony. Was happy with the room until night time when we realised the light bulbs at the balcony was missing, hence my dad had to smoke in the dark which make it very inconvenient and unsafe for senior. It is very disappointing and didn't expect this thing to happen in MBS. Other than this, the room is nice and comfy",neutral
"MBS is of course one of the icons of Singapore. Everyone should do it once, just to experience the pool. That being said, its very expensive, in my opinion for what you get. almost S$500 a night. Check in took a while, but we were given temporary access to the pool while we waited for the room, which was nice since we just stayed one night. We got an upgrade to an upper room facing the gardens with a small balcony, which was nice to watch the gardens show without having to leave. The hotel itself and the mall feel a bit ""vegas"" like and doesn't feel like authentic Singapore to me, but to each their own.",neutral
"When you are paying top dollar, you expect something extra special. You don’t expect a crowded foyer with tourists taking photos, you don’t expect to wait over 20 minutes just to get to the front of the queue to check in. Rooms were large (slightly dated). I know this this is is an iconic hotel, but I get the feeling they are just relying on this too much. They could really take this place to the next level if they wanted to, but I just feel right now, they don’t need to, as there is just so much interest in the place regardless",neutral
"While the rooms are fine and offer an excellent view to the harbor or the bay, the hotel lobby is crowded all times like a tube station at rush hour. For the charged price I expect more privacy and tranqulity. Also, in prices as they are charged by MBS I would expect breakfast to be included.",neutral
Stopped at this very symbolic hotel and was impressed with overall look of build but looking at other new hotels in area this interior is looking tired.Needs a good refurb as main foyer looks old fashioned compared to its neighbours.,neutral
"Have stayed here a few times over the years and have always enjoyed coming to MBS. However, during my most recent stay on 8th Feb, I noticed that the quality of the bed had been rather poor, causing me to experience severe back ache since the stay. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to a good night sleep at one of Singapore's best hotel but left with poor sleep and a back ache!",neutral
"Got a premier sky room which was big in size little dull very good view of the city, Long line for check in and out ,crowded pool ,very expensive terrace restaurant ,got 3 rooms ,where located in complete diferent building. You have to stay once and that was for us. Spectacular building zero five star experience",neutral

"Talk about an icon, skyline defining, world renowned, you would imagine the customer service is decent, but the front desk actually insulted me and made a mockery out of me, I have never met such a rude bunch of hotel staff in my life, in particular a staff named YURI, working the night shift.",negative
Outdated rooms and old. Towels and bathrobe provided were rough and hard. Uncomfortable bed and pillows. Huge rooms but depressing. Nothing luxury and poor service. Don’t waste your money here. Stay somewhere else,negative
"i attended a friend's wedding the other day and was really disappointed with Singapore's Iconic MBS. Within my table, there were cups that had Lipstick Marks on them. And my dish having black stains that were removable when i gently wipe them. Furthermore after reporting, they promised to get back to me. And it has been one full month. I received no calls or anything. Service Standard of Singapore is Going down the drain. As even the Representative of Singapore's Icon is providing Such atrocious service.",negative
"One of the worst hotel experience. Due to access of outsiders it creates a problem for the hotel guests. Not worth it, im never coming back here. Im probably gonna try a more professional hotel, where they do care about their guests. Its better if they would start paying attention to their own hotel guests rather the ones from outside. Im really embarrassed, came with my wife.😕😕
They couldnt arrange a table for us, were sent rudely back",negative
"Total waste of time, you queue endless for check in, have to be lucky to register for the famous pool online and then maximum 1 hour. Total waste of money currently, you not get what you expect from this price level.",negative
"It was a scary and traumatizing experience for us, as a newly wed couple, and of all places, the venue where we got married less than 12hours ago.
We had to worry for our safety and privacy staying in the bridal suite room on 26th May 2018 to 27th May 2018, as there was a person intruding into our suite room using the master access card. The person did not press the door bell, knock on the door, or even identify himself, and simply entered our room without notification. We were shocked, and shouted at the person, and the explanation given by the person was ""Checking on mini bar"". The real intention of the intruder is still unknown, we are not ruling out the possibilities of theft as well.
Response to the complaint by the managers could not explain clearly why the person entered our room without permission, simply quote it as hotel protocol to access guests room, within their rights.
We decided not to stay any longer, as we fear for our safety and there's simply no sense of security and privacy staying in such a hotel that anyone is empowered with the rights, to use the master access card to enter guest's rooms at their will. We had made a police report with regards to this incident",negative
"errible with a unfriendly and spoiler staff.
In the first place I had been queued for more than 45mins to check-in the hotel. I understand currently situation of Covid-19 so we understand.
The most terrible thing is that when we had planned and prepared a surprise for our family member, the Tower 2 staff spoiled the plan. Due to is already pass 10pm,so no visitor are allowed to come up the room. But my sister ended the work at 11pm and travel all the way here.
When I had already explained the situation to the staff and he did a damn sarcastic replied ""oh, is it. Hmm, I need to send 2 security guard to follow you guys go up and see the surprise already then send them to go down the hotel."" I was like wtf is it? Did we do anything wrong? That we need a security guard to follow us or send us to the room door. After I told them is it so difficult and I promised that they will come down within 10-15mins. So we just went up, after my sister take the gift within 10mins came down. This chinese guy ""Awan"" sarcastic told my sister ""Wa, this is fast. I was thinking to send the security guard at 12.30am and knock the door""
This is so ridiculous and terrible service I had ever get. This is spoiling your hotel standard to have this type of employee at lobby servicing customer with this kind attitude . What customer service is it?Disappointed",negative
"It’s difficult to describe the experience.... the hotel is lovely, views are breathtaking, room was sensational and we were upgraded to a beautiful suite as we were celebrating our anniversary.

The not so good experience came after we asked in the Club55 to use showers as we wanted to enjoy to pool after checking out. They offered us to use the gym facilities but forgot to mention that after check out you can’t use anymore the pool. The manager on duty was truly rude and arrogant. We finally managed to get the room checkout extended for a few hours, but as soon as we came back to the club to just wait for our taxi, we were straight away told that we had to pay for our drinks, which was not a problem, but considering the bad experience and amount of time they wasted on us, any other hotel would have just allowed their customers to enjoy the club. To summarise we were in a special celebration that was completely ruined by the arrogance of the Club55 staff. You should learnt from Ritz Carlton or even Melia hotels on how they run their executive lounges and how they train their staff",negative
"I went to this hotel again after a few years and they have not kept their standard. The room was so so dirty, the bathroom walls were covered with hair. The pool water was green. We checked out immediately and went to a different hotel.",negative
"We had the WORST & TRAUMATIZING experience at Marina Bay Sands (MBS). Please read before you book your stay here, especially if you're identified as a WOMAN of COLOR.

We had dinner @ CÉ LA VI (tower 3) & then decided to go to LAVO (tower 1) for some cocktails. On our way to LAVO, a male MBS security started charging towards us as if he was about to ATTACK us. He was shouting & accusing us of trespassing. We explained calmly that we're MBS guests, showed him our key cards & told him that we’re simply trying to get to LAVO. He continued to SCREAM & accuse us of trespassing while people were walking by. I noticed that the people passing by were either WHITE &/or MALE & were freely roaming around the rooftop, including the pool area without being approached by security. We're identified as WOMEN OF COLOR. This was when I realized that we were VICTIMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION & GENDER DISCRIMINATION! The perpetrator is MALE MBS security & his name's BREBATHARAN. I thought that I was going to get attacked by BREBATHARAN & was extremely scared for my life, so I walked away, spoke to another MBS security, explained what happened & asked if we could speak to a manager immediately. A security supervisor named LUDI came and I explained what happened. He informed us that he needs to conduct an investigation & will provide an update first thing in the morning. The next morning came & we received NO phone call, so we called security & got a hold of a female security staff named WONG & briefed her about the incident which she confirmed being aware of based on their incident report. She told us that she'll ask LUDI to follow-up with us in the evening.

LUDI finally got back to us & confirmed that the cameras showed BREBATHARAN charging & screaming at us. LUDI understood that this was a traumatizing experience so he recommended contacting Guest Service Management (GSM) to see what they can do to make sure that the rest of our stay is a pleasant one. We thanked him for his time & contacted GSM shortly. Guest Service Management's job is to make sure that they have your best interests in mind by making sure that you are taken care of during your stay, especially after the incident between us and their security staff. This is not what happened. We spoke to 2 different staff from the GSM team, one was NICOLE LEE & the other name wasn't obtained. They both accused us of lying by telling us that the security who tried to attack us wasn't an MBS security when I assured them that he is because I took a photo of his name tag & there's an incident report. They also bluntly told us that they CANNOT do anything for us & abruptly ended the call.

I travel a lot & have stayed at numerous luxurious hotels around the world & Marina Bay Sands is by far the WORST I’ve stayed at. I have never in my life experienced RACIAL DISCRIMINATION & GENDER DISCRIMINATION until I stayed here. I AM TRAUMATIZED! MBS is NOT a 5-star hotel, it’s a 1-star hotel. Spend your money someplace else where they will treat you with dignity & respect & offer world-class customer service experience. At MBS, you’re just another number, one of the thousands of walking dollar signs ($$$$) & you leave feeling like you wished you stayed somewhere else. They make guests feel like they are staying at some oppressive & cold place of business & not an inviting resort. The company is more interested in making its quarterly earnings than treating customers right. MBS’ customer service is so POOR it makes your local cable company look stellar.

I definitely will not be coming back at Marina Bay Sands in my lifetime. I’ve also informed our friends, family & followers to BOYCOTT this hotel & its owner, Las Vegas Sands for turning a blind eye on RACIAL & GENDER DISCRIMINATION within their establishment.",negative
